# Frequently Asked Questions


## What is Dark Winds?
Dark Winds is a digital collectible card game powered by the Ethereum blockchain.

## Do I need to know anything about blockchain, collectible card games or trading card games to play?
Not at all! Dark Winds was designed so that anyone can get into it regardless of how familiar they are with the blockchain or collectible card games in general. The game will teach you everything you need to know as you play it.

## On which platforms is Dark Winds available?
Dark Winds is available for Windows, MacOS or Linux computers running Firefox (with the MetaMask plugin), Chrome (with the MetaMask plugin) or the Mist browser.

## Do I need to pay to play Dark Winds?
To play Dark Winds, you need to have at least 10 cards, so you need to buy at least one booster pack in order to play. 

## How much does a card is worth?
The exact price depends on the price of Ether and Gas, but a 10-card booster pack should be around $10 USD.

## What do I need to play Dark Winds on Chrome or Firefox?
To play on Chrome or Firefox you need to install an extension named MetaMask. MetaMask makes your browser an Ethereum and cryptocollectibles wallet.

## Why is MetaMask locked?
Occasionally the ‘Wallet’ page displays a lock screen. This happens because MetaMask automatically locks your account after a certain period of time. To unlock simply click on the MetaMask extension and type in your password.

## Reinstalling MetaMask
Some users need to uninstall and reinstall MetaMask because they’ve experienced a bug. If you kept your seed words, this is very easy! Just delete the extension, reinstall it, and import your twelve seed words.

## How do I get Ether?
For U.S. citizens only: you can buy ether (ETH) in MetaMask. ETH is a digital currency that enables our game to run.
For everyone else: you will need to purchase ETH from an exchange, and then transfer the ETH from your exchange wallet to your MetaMask wallet.

## How do I send my Ether to MetaMask?
For U.S. citizens only: you are able to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask wallet using the Coinbase widget. This is more convenient and doesn’t require you to create two accounts.

For everyone else: you need to buy ETH from an exchange using normal fiat currency. Copy your MetaMask address by clicking on the large ‘…’ next to your account, then select ‘Copy Address to clipboard’. Go to your exchange, click ‘Accounts’, and select your ETH Wallet and click ‘send’. Paste the MetaMask address in the box with the amount you’d like to transfer.

[Here is](https://youtu.be/PtdMDtCVck0) a really quick video that explains how to send ETH from Coinbase to Metamask, we suggest you to check it out if you still have questions. 

## Understanding Dark Winds and cryptocollectibles

## What is a cryptocollectible? Is my Dark Winds card a cryptocollectible?
A cryptocollectible is a unique asset that is stored in a blockchain, such as the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is ‘gas’?
When you buy Dark Winds cards, trade them or sell them, that means you are doing computation on the Ethereum blockchain, and you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in Gas and gas is paid in ETH.

You are paying for the computation, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction (compute) and therefore you must pay for that computation just like you would pay for a successful transaction.

You can see your TX fee (gas limit * gas price) in ETH & USD when you search for your transaction on etherscan.io. This is not a TX fee that Dark Winds, MetaMask, or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to miners for mining transactions, putting them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.

## How do I send a Card to another player?
You can send any of your Darkwinds card to anyone in your friends list. To add a person, you must know their ETH address. Once your friends are added you can use the Card Book to transfer cards to them.

## How many cards do I need to buy to play the game?
You need to have at least 10 cards to build a deck in order to play the game.

## Will my collection on home PC be the same that the one on my laptop?
No. Your collection is uniquely tied to the MetaMask wallet installed. The only way to use the same wallet on both devices is to use the seed of an existing MetaMask wallet.

## Do I need an Internet connection to play the game?
Yes. The game is an online game that pairs you against an opponent from anywhere in the world.
